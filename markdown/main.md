# PRACTICE MARKDOWN!
---
It looks like when I type plain text, it comes out in the most
basic form. And when I enter, a new line starts. 

## How do these headers work?
--- 
## I keep adding # to see what happens
### Smaller and smaller
#### and smaller and smaller
##### and even smaller and smaller
###### how small can I go
####### well I guess this is the limit
Some weird stuff happened up there ^

# How do I manipulate my text?
---
**I can make this text bold**
__I can make this text bold too__
*I can make this text in italics*
_Same with this text_
***What about bold AND italics?***
___Oh yeah we can do that too___

> Adding a quote here
>>And a sub-quote here
>>> and another
>>>> I can go on
>>>>> and on
>>>>>> and on
>>>>>>> seemingly no end in sight

* Bullet
* Points
* Are
* Pretty
* Useful
    * and I can make them indented
        * and even more indented
            * potentially forever

# Lets make a table

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| This     | could be | tough    |
| But      | it       | works!   |

Should I redact this? ~~yes~~
Should I highlight this? ==yes==
I want math notation. x~n~^2^
